# 21 Days
An escape the maze game where time is money, literally! Every action you take in this game, including walking, costs time, and you have 21 days to get out of a never ending house with lots of interesting secrets to unfold along the way!

This project is in its **early development** phase. It currently includes working scripts for the various gameplay ingredients and features. You can read the scripts to learn more about their functionality! 

There is also a sample scene present which showcases some of the gameplay elements with dummy objects. The first level for the game is currently being designed.
