# 21 Days
21 Days is an escape the maze type of puzzle game which includes a grotesque / horror theme to it. You are trapped in a never ending house (maze), and you have 21 Days to find your way out of it. There are extraterrestrial beings wandering around in the house and you have to sneak around them in order to escape the house. There are also some items that may help you deal with these beings by stunning them or damaging them etc.

What makes this game unique is that, in this game, **time is money**. Literally! Every action in this game, including walking, costs time and the more actions you take, the lesser amount of time you have to escape the maze. In other words, you really have 21 days to escape the house!

This project is in its **early development** phase, and currently includes a sample scene with blocks to showcase some of the mechanics and gameplay elements I have coded in the game, including walking, running, picking and throwing items, finding keys and using them to unlock doors, AI idle and chasing mechanics, and the effect certain items have on them. I am currently working on the design scheme and the tutorial level for this game. You can expect to see a level and UI design in this game very soon!
