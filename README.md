An escape the maze game where time is money, literally!

This project is in its **early development** phase. It currently includes working scripts for the various gameplay ingredients and features. You can read the scripts to learn more about their functionality! 

There is also a sample scene present which showcases some of the gameplay elements with dummy objects. The first level for the game is currently being designed.
